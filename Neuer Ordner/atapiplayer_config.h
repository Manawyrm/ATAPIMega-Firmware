 * The support for the \e ATAPI scan command is optional! It is safe to enable softscan as this will work on every drive.
 * Use \e ATAPIPLAYER_SOFTFORWARD_DISTANCE and \e ATAPIPLAYER_SOFTREWIND_DISTANCE to adjust the jump distance on every fast-forward/rewind function call.
 * If softscan is disabled, the \e ATAPI scan command is used and the scan continues until the play button is pressed.

/**
 * In this mode, the player won't use the audio stop and pause commands. It seems these don't work reliable on slim-drives.
 * Instead, the complete drive is stopped. You should also enable LBA support for the ATAPI interface:
 * Before the drive is stopped, the head is moved to the beginning of the disk. This causes (some?) drives to spin down.
 * Also, the audio status on slim-drives is ignored as some drives don't seem to report play operation correctly.
