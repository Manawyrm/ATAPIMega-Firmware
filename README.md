ATAPIMega Firmware
=======

[ATAPIMega](https://github.com/Manawyrm/ATAPIMega) is a hardware project which allows regular (P)ATA CD/DVD drives to be used as a standalone Audio-CD player.  
This repository contains the (Arduino-based) firmware for the ATmega2560 microcontroller.  

### Feature/Bug Wishlist
- Show TOC info after disc insertion (total length, tracks)
- Play hidden tracks properly (Track 0, etc.)
- Playing/Skipping over the end of a CD will cause the display of erroneous info
- Eject/Play should close the tray if opened (this works on some drives, but not all!)

Project is ideally built with PlatformIO, but should work in the Arduino IDE as well.  
Pin configurations are set in the `config.h` file, look into the schematic for electrical details.  

ATAPIMega does not handle any audio data itself, the CD drive is playing the CDs standalone and only gets SCSI/ATAPI commands like Play, Pause, Next, etc. from the microcontroller. 

ATAPI and CD player implementation is based on [IDETrol](https://github.com/zwostein/idetrol) by [Tobias Himmer](https://github.com/zwostein), thanks!
